# Weather Forecast Dashboard

## Description

- My motivation to create this project was to view weather information for various cities while traveling.
- I created this project to be able to search and view temperature, humiditiy, wind speed, and uv index of a certain city.
- It looks pretty okay.

## Usage

Navigate to the deployed application page https://gnartistic.github.io/weatherForecastDash/ and enter a city name, then hit the search button. On the page the results will be displayed and you will be able to view the weather for the current date, as well as the next 5 days.
